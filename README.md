C TOTP (Time-based One Time Password) implementation for a code-generation software similar to
Google Authenticator, Authy or Aegis.

# Setup

You will need `pass` and a GPG key so in order:
```
sudo apt install pass #(Or whatever your packet manager is)
gpg --full-generate-key
...
pass init
```

After this you are ready to go, but you don't have any secrets to use, so you must import them like:
```
c2fa --import /your/export.csv --issuer (AEGIS | GOOGLE) --gpg-id example@domain.com
```

> ![note]
> Every secret is stored as an individual file with it's name as identifier.
> Also, all of this will be erased since i've did the readme then everything changed, i am fast-prototyped minded (sadly)

## 3. To-do
### 3.1 Security (Priority 1)
- [ ] Signal handling frees memory securely
-   - [ ] SIGINT
-   - [ ] SIGTERM
- [ ] Sanitization of inputs
-   - [ ] Filepath (From command line)
-   - [ ] Passphrase (For the input of passphrase of GPG)
-   - [ ] CSV Reader (This is half done if Filepath is done)
-   - [ ] Email sanitization?

### 3.2 Features
- [ ] GPG ME (GPG Made Easy) Implementation reading the files from password-store (generated by pass)
- [ ] Autolock-timer after 30-secs.
- [ ] UI with ncurses (not a priority yet)
- [ ] Import from Aegis
- [ ] Import from Google Authenticator
